## 👋 Hi there!

I'm Francis, a passionate web developer with a love for building innovative software solutions. I specialize in backend development, with expertise with the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, PHP, MySQL). I'm also involved in frontend development (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript) and working towards fullstack development.

On my GitHub, you'll find a collection of projects where I've applied my skills to tackle real-world challenges and explore new technologies. From the [PHP Google Sitemap project](https://github.com/dialeleven/php-google-sitemap) to [PHPUnit tutorial from Freecodecamp.org](https://github.com/dialeleven/php_unit_freecodecamp), each repository reflects my dedication to craftsmanship and continuous learning.
